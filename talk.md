# Summary

.huge[
* Clear advantage that ATLAS has over CMS at the moment is publication of full statistical models and rich HEPData
   - Broader community loudly wants this and wants to provide citations
* Should be thinking about connections with LHC SMEFT community
* Reuse is important

# Julia ecosystem for easier CUDA

.huge[
Julia's packaging system seems to be working, as using [CUDA libraries in Julia](https://juliagpu.org/) is rather simple.
