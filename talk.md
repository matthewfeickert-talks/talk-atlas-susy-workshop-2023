# LHC Reinterpretation Forum 2023

.kol-1-2[
.large[
* Perspectives from the [8th workshop](https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/1178/) of the [Forum on the interpretation of the LHC results for BSM studies](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCPhysics/InterpretingLHCresults)
   - First meeting of the [LHC EFT Working Group](https://lpcc.web.cern.ch/lhc-eft-wg) with the Reinterpretation Forum
   - Multiple contributions from Belle II, working to follow reinterpretation best practices

* Much to summarize from an engaging week of discussions with ATLAS, CMS, Belle II, and theory, but focusing on
   - Accomplishments in publishing .bold[rich HEPData and full statistical models]
   - Work towards publishing and reusing .bold[machine learning workflows]

# ML + reinterpretation: DNN profiled likelihoods

# ML + reinterpretation: Active learning

# ML + reinterpretation: Publication of data products

* The "Les Houches guide to reusable ML models in LHC analyses" guidelines (forthcoming) advocates
   - As ML becomes increasingly a core part of analysis workflow also important to preserve the workflows
   - Use of open source machine learning framework
   - Serialize ML model in preservation format for inference (e.g. [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/), [lwtnn](https://github.com/lwtnn/lwtnn))
]

# ML + reinterpretation: Publication of data products

.kol-1-2[
.large[
* Supplementary Material
   - Improved definitions and documentation of all input and output variables for ML model
   - Leverage .bold[validated] analysis code implementation (e.g.`rivet` or `SimpleAnlaysis`)
   - At minimum, would want a short note that could be uploaded alongside ML model serialization
* ATLAS `SimpleAnalysis` and RECAST already puts these within easy reach
]
]
.kol-1-2[
.large[
* Validation Material
   - Cutflows: When cuts depend on a neural net output
   - Along with cutflows need to know exact signal models (provide SHLA files, simulation run cards)
   - Input and output plots (especially for important features)

# Summary

.huge[
* Clear advantage that ATLAS has over CMS at the moment is publication of full statistical models and rich HEPData
   - Broader community loudly wants to use it and wants to cite it when used
   - Theory community explicitly requests full statistical models continue to be published
* ML continues to bring new approaches to reinterpretation and community recommendations
   - Les Houches guide to reusable ML models in LHC analyses guidelines
   - Across theory and experiment advantages being seen in terms of compute saving

# Reinterpretation for unbinned measurements

.kol-1-2[
.large[
* Inference-aware binning
   - Publish measurement, then for reinterpretation select optimal binning for analysis
* Derivative Measurements
   - Allows later for $f(x)$ when $x$ measured
* Extension to higher-dimensions
   - ML tools extend readily to multiple dimensions
