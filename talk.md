# LHC Reinterpretation Forum 2023

* Perspectives from the [8th workshop](https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/1178/) of the [Forum on the interpretation of the LHC results for BSM studies](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCPhysics/InterpretingLHCresults)

* Much to summarize from an engaging week of discussions with ATLAS, CMS, Belle II, and theory, but focusing on
   - Accomplishments in publishing .bold[rich HEPData and full statistical models]
   - Work towards publishing and reusing .bold[machine learning workflows]
   - First meeting of the [LHC EFT Working Group](https://lpcc.web.cern.ch/lhc-eft-wg) with the Reinterpretation Forum

# Fuller HEPData information

.kol-1-2[
.huge[
* Rich HEPData archives seen to provide useful information for theory colleagues
   - Made very clear that the information that ATLAS is providing is useful and they want to be able to cite it
* Use of ATLAS full statistical models providing enhancement to theory recasting tools by allowing use of control regions during fits

# Summary

.huge[
* Clear advantage that ATLAS has over CMS at the moment is publication of full statistical models and rich HEPData
   - Broader community loudly wants this and wants to provide citations
* Should be thinking about connections with LHC SMEFT community
* Reuse is important
